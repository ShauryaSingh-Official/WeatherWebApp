# LIVE WEATHER APP (REACT + APIs + )   

## **NOTE : ** Currently under development phase ( Please do not consider it as a final project )

<br>

## 🎓 &nbsp;Description

- A Weather Application that allows users to check the current weather for a location by making asynchronous requests (AJAX) to a weather API.

<br>

## ✍️ &nbsp;Features


1. **Homepage:** provides a simple user interface. Include a search
input field where users can enter a location (e.g., city or ZIP code) and a "Get Weather"
button to trigger the weather request.

2. **Weather Display:** Display the current weather conditions for the specified location.
Include details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description. Here , The weather api used is "OpenWeatherMap" to fetch this data.

3. **Unit Selection:** Allow users to switch between temperature units (e.g., Celsius and
Fahrenheit). Implemented with a dropdown to switch between units, and ensured that the
weather data is updated accordingly.

4. **Optional: Geolocation:** Offer the option to use the user's geolocation to automatically
fetch the weather for their current location. Ensure that you request and handle geolocation
permissions appropriately.

5. *Styling:* CSS styles have applied to make the app visually appealing and ensure a good user
experience. Pay attention to layout, color scheme, and readability.

7. **Responsive Design:** I have ensured that the app is responsive and functions well on both
desktop and mobile devices. Test its usability on various screen sizes.
